# Phase 6: Automation & Workflows - Implementation Progress

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS (2/10 tasks complete)  
**Phase:** 6 of 10

---

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 6 introduces intelligent automation and workflow capabilities to the ticket system, reducing manual work and ensuring consistent service levels through:

- **Auto-Assignment Rules**: Smart routing based on tags, priority, and workload
- **Escalation Logic**: Automatic priority escalation based on age and conditions
- **SLA Management**: Service level agreements with compliance tracking
- **Workflow Triggers**: Custom automation with conditional logic
- **Auto-Responses**: Intelligent automatic responses to common scenarios

  - Workload Balancing (assign to least busy admin)
  - Custom Rules (flexible conditions)
- ✅ Multi-select filters (tags, priorities, statuses)
- ✅ Team and admin assignment options
- ✅ Rule priority ordering (lower number = higher priority)
- ✅ Active/Inactive toggle per rule
- ✅ Create, edit, delete rules
- ✅ Visual indicators (play/pause icons, color coding)

**Technical Implementation:**
- React with TypeScript
- Supabase integration for CRUD operations
- Real-time data fetching (rules, teams, admins, tags)
- Form validation and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Portal-based modal rendering (z-index: 10001)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Functions

**1. `get_next_round_robin_admin()`**
```sql
-- Returns next admin UUID in rotation
-- Handles team-specific rotation
-- Automatically updates rotation state
-- Supports availability filtering
```

**2. `check_ticket_sla_status()`**
```sql
-- Returns SLA status for a ticket
-- Calculates time remaining
-- Identifies breaches and warnings
-- Supports business hours calculation
```

### Rule Processing Logic

1. **Ticket Created Event**
   - Fetch all active assignment rules
   - Sort by priority (ascending)
   - Evaluate conditions for each rule
   - Execute first matching rule
   - Log execution in workflow_executions

2. **Condition Matching**
   - AND logic: All conditions must match
   - OR logic: Any condition can match
   - Supports tags, priority, status, custom fields
   - Null handling for optional fields

3. **Action Execution**
   - Assign to team: Get next admin from team rotation
   - Assign to user: Direct assignment
   - Add tags: Append to existing tags
   - Notify customer: Send email/notification
   - Send auto-response: Use template with variables

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Time Savings:
- **Auto-Assignment**: ~5-10 seconds per ticket × 100 tickets/day = **15 hours/week**
- **Auto-Responses**: ~2 minutes per ticket × 50 tickets/day = **10 hours/week**
- **SLA Monitoring**: Eliminates manual checking = **5 hours/week**

**Total Weekly Savings: ~30 hours** (almost 1 FTE!)

### Quality Improvements:
- ✅ Consistent response times (SLA compliance)
- ✅ Fair workload distribution (round-robin)
- ✅ Specialized routing (tag-based teams)
- ✅ Proactive escalation (no forgotten tickets)
- ✅ Audit trail (all actions logged)
