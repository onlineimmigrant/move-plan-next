**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS (3/10 tasks complete)  
**Phase:** 7 of 10

---

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 7 creates a customer-facing portal that integrates the ticket system with the existing Help Center/Knowledge Base, reducing support volume through intelligent self-service while maintaining high-quality support for complex issues.

### Key Goals:
- **Self-Service First**: Suggest relevant KB articles before ticket creation
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered article recommendations based on query analysis
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Rating system to measure support quality
- **Engagement Tracking**: Detailed analytics on KB effectiveness
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Email, in-app, and SMS alerts

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks (3/10)

### 1. Design Customer Portal Architecture ✅

**Integration Strategy:**
- Leverage existing TicketsAccountModal for ticket viewing
- Use existing Help Center (`/help-center`) and blog_post system
- Add KnowledgeBaseWidget for inline article suggestions
- Create tracking system for measuring effectiveness

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Non-intrusive: KB suggestions don't block ticket creation
- Progressive disclosure: Show articles only when relevant
- Feedback loop: Track helpfulness to improve suggestions
- Privacy-first: Customer data protected with RLS policies

### 2. Build Knowledge Base Widget ✅

**File Created:**
- `/src/components/KnowledgeBaseWidget/KnowledgeBaseWidget.tsx` (400+ lines)

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Smart article search with keyword matching
- ✅ Relevance scoring algorithm (title=10pts, description=5pts, category=3pts, keywords=1pt each)
- ✅ Article preview with full content display
- ✅ Helpfulness voting (thumbs up/down)
- ✅ "Issue resolved" tracking
- ✅ Compact and full-width modes
- ✅ Search-as-you-type functionality
- ✅ Article click tracking
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ "View all articles" link to full help center

**Smart Suggestion Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Scoring logic:
- Exact match in title: +10 points
- Match in description: +5 points
- Match in category: +3 points
- Keyword matches: +1 point each
- Sorted by score descending
- Returns top N articles (configurable)
```

**UI Components:**

- Fallback to popular articles when no query

**Example Use Cases:**
```typescript
// Customer types: "How do I reset my password"
// System suggests:
1. "Account Password Reset Guide" (score: 15)
2. "Security Settings Overview" (score: 8)
3. "Forgot Password FAQs" (score: 6)

// Customer types: "billing issue refund"

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Smart Suggestion Algorithm:
```typescript
// 1. Parse search query
const keywords = query.split(' ').filter(w => w.length > 3);

// 2. Score each article
articles.map(article => {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Title matches (highest weight)
  if (article.title.includes(query)) score += 10;
  
  // Description matches
  if (article.description.includes(query)) score += 5;
  
  // Category matches
  if (article.category.includes(query)) score += 3;
  
  // Individual keywords
  keywords.forEach(keyword => {
    const matches = article.text.match(keyword);
    score += matches.length;
  });
  
  return { article, score };
});

// 3. Return top N by score
return scoredArticles
  .filter(({ score }) => score > 0)
  .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
  .slice(0, maxSuggestions);
```

### Tracking Implementation:
```typescript
// When customer views article
await trackArticleView(articleId, searchQuery);

// When customer votes
await trackHelpfulness(articleId, isHelpful);

// When issue is resolved
await trackResolution(articleId, resolvedWithoutTicket);

// When ticket is created anyway
await linkArticleToTicket(articleId, ticketId);
```

### Notification Flow:
```typescript
// 1. Event occurs (new response, status change, etc.)
triggerNotification(ticketId, eventType);

// 2. Check customer preferences
const prefs = await getNotificationPreferences(customerId);

// 3. Respect quiet hours
const sendTime = await getNextSendTime(customerId, now);

// 4. Queue notification
await queueNotification({
  recipient: customerId,
  channel: prefs.preferredChannel,
  template: eventType,
  scheduledFor: sendTime
});

// 5. Background job processes queue
processNotificationQueue();
```
