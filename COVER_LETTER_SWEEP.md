**Re: Senior AI Engineer Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior AI Engineer position at Sweep. With over 12 years of software engineering experience and 6+ years specializing in AI/ML systems, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Sweep's mission of leveraging technology to combat climate change—the defining challenge of our era.

## Why I'm an Exceptional Fit for Sweep

### Production AI Agent Systems in Action

At Online Immigrant Services and MetExam, I have designed and deployed AI agent systems that serve real users daily across multiple domains:

- **Built intelligent conversational agents** integrated into a multi-tenant SaaS platform supporting 10+ locales, handling 1000+ daily interactions
- **Developed LLM orchestration framework** supporting GPT-4, Claude, Grok-3, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-4, and custom endpoints with flexible model switching
- **Created context management pipelines** pulling from PostgreSQL databases with Row Level Security, ensuring proper data grounding for agent responses
- **Implemented comprehensive observability** with structured logging, error tracking, and agent performance monitoring

### AI-Driven Educational Innovation

Through MetExam's EduPro module, I created **AI algorithms that increase learning retention by 3-5x**, demonstrating my ability to build GenAI features that deliver measurable real-world impact. This involved:

- Designing evaluation frameworks with predefined test scenarios and real user feedback loops
- Building guardrails and fallback strategies ensuring consistent agent quality
- Implementing feedback mechanisms that continuously refine model performance

### Backend Engineering Excellence (Python & Beyond)

My technical foundation is rock-solid:

- **Python expertise**: Built Django-based platforms, RESTful APIs, and database architectures with PostgreSQL
- **Full-stack proficiency**: TypeScript/JavaScript with React, Next.js 14, Node.js
- **50+ production API routes** handling authentication, data validation, async processing, and webhook orchestration
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Automated Vercel deployment pipelines, CI/CD workflows, environment variable management

### Production-Grade Infrastructure & Scalability

I've architected systems that scale:

- Built **multi-tenant SaaS platform** serving 100+ organizations with isolated data storage and RLS security
- Designed **automated deployment pipelines** using Vercel, GitHub Actions, and infrastructure-as-code
- Implemented **monitoring and observability** across the full stack—from database queries to agent responses
- Optimized for performance with SSR/SSG, edge functions, and <2s initial page loads

### Pragmatic, Iterative, User-Focused

I thrive in fast-paced environments:

- **Ship fast, learn fast**: Rapid iteration cycles with feature flags and staged rollouts
- **Real user feedback**: Built feedback loops into every AI feature, continuously improving based on actual usage
- **Cross-functional collaboration**: Work seamlessly with designers, product managers, and engineers to deliver polished experiences

### Professional Qualifications & Domain Expertise

Beyond technical skills, I bring:

- **IBM Data Science & Applied AI Specializations (2019)**: Certified expertise in ML and AI application development
- **Published Author**: 16 best-selling legal books on Amazon, demonstrating ability to communicate complex concepts clearly
- **Professional certifications**: DipFA (Financial Adviser), CeMAP (Mortgage Adviser), OISC (Immigration Adviser), SQE (Solicitors Qualifying Examination)—showcasing my ability to master complex regulated domains

### Alignment with Sweep's Mission

Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation. I am deeply motivated to apply my proven AI engineering skills to help companies measure, manage, and reduce their environmental impact. The intersection of intelligent agents, sustainability data, and compliance navigation is exactly where I want to focus my career.

## What I Bring to Sweep

✅ **Production AI agent experience** with real users and measurable outcomes  
✅ **Full-stack technical depth** (Python, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, cloud infrastructure)  
✅ **Proven ability to ship fast** and iterate based on feedback  
✅ **Evaluation and quality mindset** with guardrails and observability built-in  
✅ **Passion for climate impact** and using technology to solve meaningful problems  

I would be thrilled to discuss how my experience building production AI agents, scalable backend systems, and user-focused GenAI features can contribute to Sweep's mission. Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,  
**Andrei Vialichka**
