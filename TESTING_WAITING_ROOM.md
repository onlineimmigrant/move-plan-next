# Testing Waiting Room - Step by Step Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Development URL Links Fixed
**Issue:** Email links using production domain in development
**Fix:** `/src/app/api/meetings/instant-invite/route.ts`
- Now uses `http://localhost:3000` in development
- Uses production domain in production

### 2. Waiting Room to Video Call Transition Fixed
**Issue:** Yellow circle (connecting) instead of video call after approval
**Fix:** `/src/components/modals/MeetingsModals/ManagedVideoCall.tsx`
- Added `handleStatusChange` that fetches Twilio token when approved
- Properly updates context with token and room name
- Transitions from waiting room to video call seamlessly

## üß™ Test Plan

### Prerequisites
Before testing, verify migration is applied:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'bookings' 
AND column_name = 'waiting_since';
```

**Expected:** Returns 1 row

**If returns 0:** Apply migration from `/migrations/add_waiting_status_to_bookings.sql`

### Test 1: Instant Meeting Email Link (Development)

**Steps:**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Meetings ‚Üí Admin View
3. Click "+ Send Instant Invite"
4. Fill form:
   - Customer Email: (your email)
   - Customer Name: Test User
   - Meeting Title: Test Meeting
   - Leave other fields default
5. Submit

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Success toast appears
- ‚úÖ Check email inbox
- ‚úÖ Email received with meeting invitation
- ‚úÖ Click "Join Video Meeting" button
- ‚úÖ Link goes to: `http://localhost:3000/meetings/join/{booking_id}`
- ‚úÖ NOT `https://production-domain.com/...`

**Actual Result in Development:**
```
Email link should be: http://localhost:3000/meetings/join/abc-123-def
NOT: https://yourdomain.com/meetings/join/abc-123-def
```

### Test 3: Edge Cases

#### Edge Case 1: Customer Joins After Start Time

**Setup:**
1. Create booking with start time in the PAST
2. Login as customer
3. Try to join

**Expected:**
- ‚ùå Should NOT enter waiting room
- ‚úÖ Should join video call directly (if within allowed window)
- OR show "Meeting has ended" if too late

#### Edge Case 2: Admin Joins Before Start Time

**Setup:**
1. Create booking 10 min in future
2. Login as admin
3. Try to join

**Expected:**
- ‚ùå Should NOT enter waiting room (admin bypass)
- ‚úÖ Should join video call directly
- ‚úÖ Console log shows: `isAdmin: true, shouldEnterWaitingRoom: false`

#### Edge Case 3: Host Joins Before Start Time

**Setup:**
1. Create booking with YOU as host, 10 min in future
2. Try to join

**Expected:**
- ‚ùå Should NOT enter waiting room (host bypass)
- ‚úÖ Should join video call directly
- ‚úÖ Console log shows: `isHost: true, shouldEnterWaitingRoom: false`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing yellow circle instead of waiting room

**Check:**
1. Open browser console
2. Look for `[useMeetingLauncher]` logs
3. Check if `shouldEnterWaitingRoom` is `true`
4. Check if waiting room API call succeeded

**If `shouldEnterWaitingRoom: false`:**
- Verify you're NOT logged in as admin
- Verify meeting is in the future
- Verify you're not the host

**If API call fails:**
- Check Network tab for error response
- Verify migration was applied
- Check booking exists in database

### Issue: Email link goes to production domain

**Check:**
```bash
# In terminal, check environment:
echo $NODE_ENV
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
```

**Expected in development:**
```
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**If wrong:** Update `.env.local`

### Issue: Waiting room doesn't transition to video call

**Check console logs:**
```
[ManagedVideoCall] Status changed to in_progress, fetching Twilio token...
```

**If missing:** Check if host actually clicked "Admit"

**If shows error:** Check API response in Network tab

## üìù Notes

**When testing in incognito:**
- You'll need to login as customer
- Make sure customer account is NOT admin
- Clear cookies between tests

**Production vs Development:**
- Development: Uses localhost URLs
- Production: Uses settings.domain from database

**Status Flow:**
```
confirmed ‚Üí [customer joins early] ‚Üí waiting ‚Üí [host approves] ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí [call ends] ‚Üí completed
                                              ‚Üì
                                        [host denies] ‚Üí cancelled
```

## üÜò If All Else Fails

1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE id = 'booking-id'`
4. Verify `status` column value
5. Verify `waiting_since` column exists
6. Check server logs for errors
7. Open `/WAITING_ROOM_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed diagnostics
