# Image Gallery Upload Feature

## Overview
Added upload functionality to the ImageGalleryModal component, allowing admins to upload images directly to the Supabase storage gallery bucket.

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Upload
- **Multiple file selection**: Users can select and upload multiple images at once
- **Drag-and-drop support**: Native browser file picker with multi-select
- **File validation**:
  - Allowed formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP
  - Maximum file size: 5MB per file
  - Invalid files are skipped with console warnings

### 2. Smart File Naming
- Automatically generates unique filenames to prevent conflicts
- Format: `{original-name}-{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`
- Sanitizes filenames: converts to lowercase, replaces non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens
- Example: `my-logo.png` → `my-logo-1696694400000-a7b3c.png`

### 3. Upload Progress & Feedback
- **Real-time progress**: Shows "Uploading X of Y..." during upload
- **Success message**: Displays "✅ X images uploaded successfully!" for 3 seconds
- **Error handling**: Shows specific error messages for failed uploads
- **Upload counter**: Tracks successful and failed uploads separately

### 4. UI Components
- **Upload button**: Primary action button with upload icon
- **Refresh button**: Manual refresh option with spinning icon during load
- **Progress indicator**: Green animated dot with status text
- **Tooltips**: Helpful hints about file requirements on hover

### 5. User Experience
- Disabled buttons during upload to prevent double-submission
- Automatic gallery refresh after successful upload
- File input is cleared after upload completes
- Console logging for debugging and tracking

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState<string>('');
const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
```

### File Upload Handler
- Validates file type and size
- Uploads to Supabase storage with proper content-type
- Uses `upsert: false` to prevent overwriting existing files
- Handles errors gracefully without stopping batch upload

### Supabase Storage
- Bucket: `gallery`
- Public bucket with RLS policy for read access
- Service role key used for uploads (admin-only)

## Usage

### For Admins
1. Open any post in edit mode
2. Click the image icon in the editor toolbar
3. Click the "Upload" button in the gallery modal
4. Select one or more image files (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP)
5. Wait for upload to complete
6. Images appear immediately in the gallery
7. Select the new image to insert into post

### File Requirements
- **Formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP
- **Max Size**: 5MB per file
- **Quantity**: Multiple files can be uploaded at once
- **Naming**: Original names are preserved with unique identifiers added

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/ImageGalleryModal/ImageGalleryModal.tsx`
  - Added upload functionality
  - Added progress tracking
  - Added refresh button
  - Enhanced error handling

## Future Enhancements
- Drag-and-drop zone for easier uploads
- Image preview before upload
- Bulk delete functionality
- Organization-specific folders (e.g., `gallery/{org_id}/`)
- Image optimization/compression on upload
- Thumbnail generation
- Upload progress bar with percentage
- Image metadata editing (alt text, captions)

## Testing
Tested with:
- ✅ Single file upload
- ✅ Multiple file upload
- ✅ Large files (over 5MB) - correctly rejected
- ✅ Invalid file types - correctly rejected
- ✅ Duplicate filenames - correctly handled with unique identifiers
- ✅ Upload error handling
- ✅ Gallery refresh after upload

## Security Considerations
- File type validation on client side
- File size limits enforced
- Supabase storage RLS policies in place
- Admin-only access to upload functionality
- Sanitized filenames to prevent injection

## Performance
- Async upload processing
- Non-blocking UI during upload
- Batch processing with individual file error handling
- Automatic gallery refresh optimized to only fetch once after all uploads
