# Current Status Summary

## What's Happening Now

### ‚ùå Errors You're Seeing:

1. **"Failed to fetch" in InstantMeetingModal**
   - Cause: Trying to create booking with invalid enum value 'waiting'
   - Status: Will work once migration applied

2. **"Failed to fetch" in WaitingRoomControls**
   - Cause: Querying bookings WHERE status = 'waiting' (enum value doesn't exist yet)
   - Status: Will work once migration applied

3. **No email sent**
   - Cause: Booking creation fails ‚Üí email code never runs
   - Status: Will work once migration applied

4. **Meeting not in "My Meetings"**
   - Cause: Booking creation fails ‚Üí no booking to show
   - Status: Will work once migration applied

### ‚úÖ What I Just Fixed:

1. **Better error messages in APIs**
   - Now tells you if migration is missing
   - Console shows: "Database migration required. Please apply /migrations/add_waiting_status_to_bookings.sql"

2. **Email sending improvements**
   - Added validation for NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
   - Added detailed logging to track email sending
   - Better error handling if email fails (doesn't crash the request)

3. **Waiting room logic**
   - Changed from time-based to status-based
   - Now works for instant meetings (not just scheduled)

## üö® ACTION REQUIRED: Apply Database Migration

**You MUST run the migration before anything will work!**

### Quick Steps:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí SQL Editor

2. **Copy entire contents** of `/migrations/add_waiting_status_to_bookings.sql`

3. **Paste and RUN** in SQL Editor

4. **Verify** with:
   ```sql
   SELECT enumlabel FROM pg_enum 
   JOIN pg_type ON pg_enum.enumtypid = pg_type.oid 
   WHERE pg_type.typname = 'booking_status';
   ```
   Should see 'waiting' in the list!

5. **Restart dev server**: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again
