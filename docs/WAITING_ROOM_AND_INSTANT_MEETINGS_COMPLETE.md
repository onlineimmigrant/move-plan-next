# Waiting Room & Instant Meeting Invitations - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of:
1. **Waiting Room & Host Approval** - Customers wait for host approval before joining
2. **Instant Meeting Invitations** - Admins can send instant meeting invites via email
3. **Enhanced Admin Controls** - View waiting participants, approve/reject access

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Database Migration Required

**The waiting room feature will NOT work until you apply the database migration!**

### Apply Migration via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the contents of `/migrations/add_waiting_status_to_bookings.sql`
5. Paste into the editor
6. Click **Run** to execute

### Apply Migration via Supabase CLI

```bash
# Make sure you have Supabase CLI installed and linked
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
supabase db push
```

### Verify Migration Success

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check if waiting status exists
SELECT enumlabel 
FROM pg_enum 
JOIN pg_type ON pg_enum.enumtypid = pg_type.oid 
WHERE pg_type.typname = 'booking_status';

-- Check if new columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'bookings' 
AND column_name IN ('waiting_since', 'approved_by', 'rejected_by', 'approved_at', 'rejected_at', 'rejection_reason');
```

Expected results:
- Should see 'waiting' in the status enum list
- Should see all 6 new columns listed

## Feature 1: Waiting Room & Host Approval

### How It Works

1. **Customer Joins Early**
   - Customer clicks meeting link before scheduled time
   - System automatically routes them to waiting room
   - Booking status changes to 'waiting'
   - Customer sees animated waiting screen with timer

2. **Host Notification**
   - Admin/Host opens MeetingsAdminModal
   - WaitingRoomControls panel shows at top of bookings list
   - Displays all participants waiting with their info:
     - Customer name and email
     - Meeting title
     - How long they've been waiting

3. **Host Actions**
   - **Admit Button**: Approves participant, changes status to 'in_progress', customer proceeds to video call
   - **Deny Button**: Rejects participant with optional reason, changes status to 'cancelled'

### Files Created/Modified

**New API Endpoints:**
- `/api/meetings/waiting-room/enter` - POST: Enter waiting room, GET: List waiting participants
- `/api/meetings/waiting-room/approve` - POST: Host approves participant
- `/api/meetings/waiting-room/reject` - POST: Host rejects participant

**New Components:**
- `/src/components/modals/MeetingsModals/WaitingRoom/WaitingRoom.tsx` - Customer waiting screen
- `/src/components/modals/MeetingsModals/WaitingRoom/WaitingRoomControls.tsx` - Host control panel

**Modified Files:**
- `/src/types/meetings.ts` - Added 'waiting' status and waiting room fields
- `/src/context/MeetingContext.tsx` - Updated Booking interface
- `/src/components/modals/MeetingsModals/ManagedVideoCall.tsx` - Integrated WaitingRoom
- `/src/hooks/useMeetingLauncher.ts` - Added waiting room entry logic
- `/src/components/modals/MeetingsModals/MeetingsAdminModal/AdminBookingsList.tsx` - Integrated WaitingRoomControls

### Testing the Waiting Room

1. **Apply the database migration first!** (See instructions above)

2. **Create a test booking:**
   ```bash
   # Use Supabase SQL Editor or your admin interface
   # Create a booking scheduled 5 minutes from now
   ```

3. **Test as customer:**
   - Navigate to `/meetings/join/{booking_id}` BEFORE the scheduled time
   - Should see waiting room screen
   - Timer should show how long you've been waiting

4. **Test as host:**
   - Open admin panel â†’ Meetings
   - Should see waiting room controls at top
   - Should see the waiting participant
   - Click "Admit" - customer should proceed to video call

5. **Test rejection:**
   - Have another customer join early
   - Click "Deny" and enter optional reason
   - Customer should see rejection message

### Status Flow

```
Customer joins early â†’ 'waiting' â†’ Host approves â†’ 'in_progress' â†’ Call ends â†’ 'completed'
                                 â†“
                         Host denies â†’ 'cancelled'
```

## Feature 2: Instant Meeting Invitations

### How It Works

1. **Admin Initiates**
   - Admin opens MeetingsAdminModal â†’ Bookings List
   - Clicks "Send Instant Invite" button
   - Modal opens with form

2. **Form Fields**
   - Meeting Type (dropdown)
   - Meeting Title
   - Customer Name
   - Customer Email
   - Duration (pre-filled from meeting type)
   - Optional Notes

3. **System Actions**
   - Creates booking with `scheduled_at = NOW`
   - Status automatically set to 'confirmed'
   - Sends email invitation using AWS SES
   - Email contains:
     - Meeting details
     - Host name
     - "Join Now" button with meeting link
     - Optional notes from admin

4. **Customer Experience**
   - Receives email immediately
   - Clicks "Join Video Meeting" button
   - Joins video call directly (no waiting room since it's instant)

### Files Created

**New API Endpoint:**
- `/src/app/api/meetings/instant-invite/route.ts` - POST: Create instant meeting and send email

**New Component:**
- `/src/components/modals/MeetingsModals/InstantMeetingModal.tsx` - Instant invite form modal

**Modified Files:**
- `/src/app/api/send-email/route.ts` - Added `meeting_invitation` email template (plain text & HTML)
- `/src/components/modals/MeetingsModals/MeetingsAdminModal/AdminBookingsList.tsx` - Added instant meeting button

### Email Template

The system uses two email templates for meeting invitations:

**Plain Text:**
```
Hi {{name}},

You've been invited to a video meeting!

Meeting Details:
- Meeting: {{meeting_title}}
- Host: {{host_name}}
- Date & Time: {{meeting_time}}
- Duration: {{duration_minutes}} minutes
- Notes: {{meeting_notes}}

Join the meeting: {{emailDomainRedirection}}
```

**HTML:**
- Styled info box with meeting details
- Large blue "Join Video Meeting" button
- Meeting link at bottom
- Responsive design

### Testing Instant Meetings

1. **Open admin panel:**
   ```
   Navigate to Meetings â†’ Admin View
   ```

2. **Click "Send Instant Invite" button:**
   - Should open modal with form

3. **Fill out form:**
   - Select meeting type
   - Enter test customer email (use your own)
   - Enter customer name
   - Add meeting title: "Quick Test Meeting"
   - Optional: Add notes

4. **Submit form:**
   - Should see success toast
   - Check email inbox
   - Should receive invitation email with meeting link

5. **Test email link:**
   - Click "Join Video Meeting" button in email
   - Should go directly to video call (no waiting room)

### API Request Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/meetings/instant-invite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "meeting_type_id": "uuid-of-meeting-type",
    "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "title": "Quick Consultation",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "notes": "Looking forward to speaking with you!",

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your production URL

# AWS SES (for emails)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)

Make sure your `bookings` table has appropriate RLS policies:

```sql
-- Allow admins to read all bookings in their organization
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view organization bookings"
ON bookings FOR SELECT
USING (
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT id FROM profiles 
    WHERE organization_id = bookings.organization_id 
    AND role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Allow admins to update bookings in their organization
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update organization bookings"
ON bookings FOR UPDATE
USING (
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT id FROM profiles 
    WHERE organization_id = bookings.organization_id 
    AND role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Waiting Room Not Appearing

**Problem:** Customer joins early but goes straight to video call

**Solutions:**
1. **Check database migration:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE id = 'booking-id';
   -- Should have waiting_since, approved_by, etc columns
   ```

2. **Check useMeetingLauncher logic:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for "Should enter waiting room" log
   - Verify `isAdmin`, `isHost`, and time calculations

3. **Check booking status:**
   ```sql
   -- Status should change to 'waiting' when customer joins early
   SELECT id, status, waiting_since FROM bookings WHERE id = 'booking-id';
   ```

### Email Not Sending

**Problem:** Instant meeting created but no email received

**Solutions:**
1. **Check AWS SES configuration:**
   - Verify email address is verified in AWS SES
   - Check SES sending limits (sandbox vs production)

2. **Check API logs:**
   ```bash
   # Check browser network tab
   # Look for /api/send-email request
   # Check response for errors
   ```

3. **Test email endpoint directly:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/send-email \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "type": "meeting_invitation",
       "to": "test@example.com",
       "organization_id": "your-org-id",
       "name": "Test User",
       "emailDomainRedirection": "https://example.com",
       "placeholders": {
         "meeting_title": "Test Meeting",
         "host_name": "Admin",
         "meeting_time": "Now",
         "duration_minutes": "30",
         "meeting_notes": "",
         "meeting_notes_html": ""
       }
     }'
   ```

### Controls Not Visible

**Problem:** Admin doesn't see waiting room controls or instant meeting button

**Solutions:**
1. **Check user role:**
   ```sql
   SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = 'user-id';
   -- Should be 'admin'
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

3. **Check component rendering:**
   - Open React DevTools
   - Search for `WaitingRoomControls` component
   - Verify it's mounted with correct props

### Database Migration Errors

**Problem:** Migration fails with "relation already exists" or "type already exists"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check if migration was already applied:**
   ```sql
   -- Check for waiting status
   SELECT unnest(enum_range(NULL::booking_status));
   ```

2. **If partially applied, rollback and reapply:**
   ```sql
   -- Remove new columns if they exist
   ALTER TABLE bookings DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS waiting_since;
   -- ... drop other columns ...
   
   -- Then run full migration again
   ```

3. **Manual cleanup if needed:**
   ```sql
   -- Drop and recreate status enum (CAREFUL - this affects existing data)
   ALTER TABLE bookings ALTER COLUMN status TYPE text;
   DROP TYPE IF EXISTS booking_status;
   CREATE TYPE booking_status AS ENUM (...);
   ALTER TABLE bookings ALTER COLUMN status TYPE booking_status USING status::booking_status;
   ```

## Performance Considerations

### Polling Intervals

The system uses polling to check for status updates:

- **WaitingRoom (customer):** Polls every 3 seconds
- **WaitingRoomControls (host):** Polls every 5 seconds

**Optimization Ideas:**
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Use Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- Add exponential backoff for polling

### Database Indexes

Consider adding indexes for common queries:

```sql
-- Index for waiting room queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status_waiting 
ON bookings(status) 
WHERE status = 'waiting';

-- Index for organization bookings
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_org_scheduled 
ON bookings(organization_id, scheduled_at);

-- Index for host bookings
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_host 
ON bookings(host_user_id, scheduled_at);
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

1. **Waiting Room Approval:**
   - Only booking host or admin can approve/reject
   - Verified via `host_user_id` or profile role check

2. **Instant Meetings:**
   - Only admins can send instant invites
   - Enforced at API level with role check

3. **Email Security:**
   - Meeting links should use secure tokens
   - Consider adding expiration to links
   - Validate booking ownership before joining

### Rate Limiting

Consider implementing rate limits for:
- Instant meeting creation (prevent spam)
- Waiting room approval requests
- Email sending (prevent abuse)

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **WebSocket Integration**
   - Replace polling with real-time updates
   - Use Supabase Realtime or Socket.io

2. **Meeting Recordings**
   - Save recording metadata to database
   - Link recordings to bookings

3. **Meeting Analytics**
   - Track join times, duration, participants
   - Generate reports for admins

4. **Calendar Integration**
   - Sync meetings to Google Calendar, Outlook
   - Send calendar invites with emails

5. **SMS Notifications**
   - Send SMS reminders before meetings
   - SMS alerts when admitted from waiting room

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Customer can enter waiting room
- [ ] Host can see waiting participants
- [ ] Host can approve participants
- [ ] Host can reject participants
- [ ] Instant meeting modal opens
