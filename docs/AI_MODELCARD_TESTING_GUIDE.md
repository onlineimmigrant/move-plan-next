# AI Model Card - Quick Testing Guide

## What Was Done

I've completely rewritten the shared `AIModelCard` component to match the **original ModelCard's beautiful styling**. The new version has all the sophisticated animations and hover effects that make the original so polished.

## Key Improvements âœ¨

### 1. **Card Hover Effects**
- Border color animates from light blue to darker blue
- Shadow intensifies with a glow effect
- Card lifts up slightly (`-translate-y-1`)

### 2. **Icon with Animated Glow** 
- Blue glow appears behind icon on hover
- Icon scales up smoothly
- Blur effect creates soft halo

### 3. **Enhanced Badges**
- **Admin Badge**: Blue with hover color change
- **Role Badge**: Amber theme with scale animation + User icon
- **Active Status**: Green with pulse animation (looks "alive")

### 4. **Sophisticated Buttons**
- All buttons scale up on hover (105%)
- **Edit**: Blue theme with color transitions
- **Delete**: Red theme with warning colors
- **Toggle**: Gray (active) or green (inactive) with smooth transitions
- Buttons fade in only on card hover (admin context)

### 5. **New Features**
- Task badges with purple theme
- Zap icon âš¡ for max tokens
- Selection indicator badge (account context)
- Dynamic theme color support

## How to Test

### Step 1: Enable the New Component
In `/src/app/[locale]/admin/ai-models/page.tsx` around **line 22**:

```tsx
// Change this line:
const USE_NEW_COMPONENT = false;

// To:
const USE_NEW_COMPONENT = true;
```

### Step 2: View the Admin Page
1. Navigate to `/admin/ai-models`
2. You should now see the new styled cards

### Step 3: Test These Features

#### Card Hover
- [ ] Hover over a card - does the border change color?
- [ ] Does a blue glow appear around the card?
- [ ] Does the card lift up slightly?

#### Icon Animation
- [ ] Hover over a card - does a glow appear behind the icon?
- [ ] Does the icon scale up smoothly?

#### Badges
- [ ] Hover over "Admin" badge - does it change color?
- [ ] Hover over Role badge - does it scale slightly?
- [ ] Does active status have a pulsing green dot?

#### Buttons (Admin Context)
- [ ] Buttons hidden by default?
- [ ] Buttons fade in on card hover?
- [ ] Edit button: Blue, scales on hover?
- [ ] Delete button: Red, scales on hover?
- [ ] Toggle button: Gray/Green, scales on hover?

#### Tasks
- [ ] Task badges displayed in purple?
- [ ] Long tasks truncated with "..."?
- [ ] "+X more" button for overflow tasks?

#### General
- [ ] All animations smooth (not janky)?
- [ ] Colors match your brand theme?
- [ ] Everything readable and clear?

### Step 4: Compare with Original
To compare side-by-side, you can temporarily set `USE_NEW_COMPONENT = false` to see the old version, then switch back to `true`.

## Expected Visual Quality

The new component should have **the same visual polish** as the original:
- âœ… Smooth hover animations
- âœ… Dynamic color changes
- âœ… Professional shadow effects
- âœ… Animated badge transitions
- âœ… Button scale effects
- âœ… Pulse animations

## If Something Looks Wrong

### Issue: Colors don't match theme
- Check that the `primary` prop is being passed correctly
- The component supports both single colors and color objects

### Issue: Animations are janky
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Verify CSS transitions are enabled

### Issue: Buttons don't appear on hover
- Verify you're in admin context
- Check that the `group` className is working
- Look for CSS conflicts

### Issue: Icons missing
- Check that `AIIcons.User` and `AIIcons.Zap` are available
- Verify icons were added to `/src/components/ai/_shared/components/AIIcons.tsx`

## Rollback if Needed

If the new styling isn't ready or has issues:

```tsx
// In page.tsx, set back to:
const USE_NEW_COMPONENT = false;
```

This instantly reverts to the original component - **zero risk!**

## Files Changed

   - Location: `/src/components/ai/_shared/components/AIModelCard.tsx`

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Styling Looks Good âœ…
1. Keep `USE_NEW_COMPONENT = true`
2. Test for a day or two
3. Enable in account page as well
4. Plan migration after validation period
