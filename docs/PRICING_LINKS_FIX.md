# Advanced Pricing Links Fix

## Problem Description

The advanced product pricing links were not working when navigating directly to URLs like `/#pricing#premium_package`. Only the basic `/#pricing` link worked, always opening the modal with the first product.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `HomePage.tsx` component's hash detection logic. The modal opening logic was checking for an exact match with `#pricing`:

```typescript
// ❌ Old logic - only exact match
setIsPricingModalOpen(hash === '#pricing');
```

This meant that URLs like `/#pricing#premium_package` would not open the modal because they don't exactly match `#pricing`.

## Solution

Updated the hash detection logic in `HomePage.tsx` to support both formats:

```typescript
// ✅ New logic - supports extended format
const hashParts = hash.split('#').filter(Boolean);
const isPricingHash = hashParts.length > 0 && hashParts[0] === 'pricing';
setIsPricingModalOpen(isPricingHash);
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/HomePageSections/HomePage.tsx`

**Changed:**
- `handleHashChange()` function - Updated hash detection logic
- `handleOpenPricingModal()` function - Improved hash setting logic
- `handleClick()` function - Enhanced hash management
- `handleClosePricingModal()` function - Updated hash removal logic

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Hash detection now supports both formats
const hashParts = hash.split('#').filter(Boolean);
const isPricingHash = hashParts.length > 0 && hashParts[0] === 'pricing';

// Hash removal now handles extended format
if (hashParts.length > 0 && hashParts[0] === 'pricing') {
  window.history.replaceState(null, '', url);
}

// Hash setting preserves existing pricing hashes
const hasPricingHash = hashParts.length > 0 && hashParts[0] === 'pricing';
if (!hasPricingHash) {
  window.history.replaceState(null, '', window.location.pathname + window.location.search + '#pricing');
}
```

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated `/docs/ADVANCED_PRICING_LINKS.md` with technical details
- Created `/docs/PRICING_LINKS_FIX.md` (this file) documenting the fix

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Basic pricing link:**
   ```
   /#pricing
   ```
   Should open modal with first product.

2. **Product-specific links:**
   ```
   /#pricing#basic_plan
   /#pricing#premium_package
   /#pricing#123
   ```
   Should open modal with the specified product selected.

3. **Invalid product links:**
   ```
   /#pricing#nonexistent_product
   ```
   Should open modal with first product as fallback.

## How It Works Now

1. **URL Detection:** Any hash starting with `#pricing` will open the modal
2. **Product Selection:** The `PricingModal` component parses the full hash and selects the appropriate product
3. **Fallback:** If no matching product is found, defaults to the first product
4. **URL Updates:** When users switch products in the modal, the URL updates accordingly
5. **Cleanup:** When modal closes, any pricing-related hash is removed

## Benefits

- ✅ Direct links to specific products now work
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Improved user experience for marketing campaigns
- ✅ Better SEO and sharing capabilities
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality remains intact:
- `/#pricing` links continue to work as before
- Modal behavior is unchanged for users
- No breaking changes to existing code
