## Choosing Your AI Models

One of Coded Harmony's most powerful features is its flexible AI system. Let's set up the AI models that will power your business.

### Understanding AI Models

**What are AI Models?**
AI models are the "brains" behind various intelligent features in Coded Harmony. Each model is trained for specific tasks like writing content, answering questions, or analyzing data.

**Why Multiple Models?**
Different AI models excel at different tasks:
- **GPT-4**: Best for creative writing, complex reasoning
- **Claude 3**: Excellent for long-form content, analysis
- **Grok**: Great for real-time information, conversational tone

### Step 2: Configure Organization Models (Optional)

Create custom AI models tailored to your business needs.

- You want to combine multiple capabilities
- You need industry-specific compliance rules

**To Create a Custom Model:**

1. **Go to "Add Model" Tab**

2. **Fill in Model Details:**
   
   **Basic Information:**
   - **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Acme Legal Client Intake Assistant")
   - **Role**: What this AI does (e.g., "Client intake specialist")
   - **Icon**: Choose an icon to represent this model
   
   **AI Configuration:**
   - **Base Model**: Choose foundation (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
   - **System Message**: Instructions that guide the AI's behavior
     ```
     Example for law firm:
     "You are a client intake specialist for Acme Legal Services,
     a firm specializing in family law and estate planning.
     Your tone is professional yet warm. You help potential clients
     understand our services and gather initial information.
     Always mention our free 30-minute consultation."
     ```
   - **Max Tokens**: Response length limit (100-2000)
   - **Temperature**: Creativity level (0=focused, 1=creative)
   
   **API Configuration (Advanced):**
   - **API Key**: Your API key for the AI provider
   - **Endpoint**: API URL (usually pre-filled)
   - **Custom Parameters**: JSON configuration for advanced users
   
   **Access Control:**
   - **Who can use this?** All users, Admins only, Specific roles
   - **Token Limit per User**: Daily/weekly/monthly quota
   - **Active Status**: Enable/disable the model

3. **Define Tasks (Optional but Powerful)**
   
   Tasks are predefined workflows that make AI even more useful:
   
   **Example Task: "Generate Client Welcome Email"**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Client Welcome Email",
     "description": "Create personalized welcome email for new clients",
     "prompt_template": "Write a welcome email for {client_name} who hired us for {case_type}. Include information about {attorney_name} and next steps.",
     "variables": ["client_name", "case_type", "attorney_name"],
     "output_format": "email"
   }
   ```
   
   Users can then fill in the variables and get consistent, branded output.

4. **Test Your Model**
   - Use the test interface to validate behavior
   - Try different prompts and scenarios
   - Adjust system message if results aren't ideal

5. **Save and Enable**
   - Click "Save Model"
   - Toggle "Active" to make it available
   - Model appears in "Models" tab for all users

**💡 Pro Tip**: Start with a broad model and create specialized versions as needs emerge.

### Step 3: Set User Quotas and Policies

Control AI usage to manage costs and ensure fair access.

**Organization-Wide Settings:**

1. **Navigate to**: Admin → AI → Settings

2. **Configure Token Budgets:**
   - **Monthly Organization Budget**: Total tokens for all users
   - **Default User Quota**: Tokens per user per month
   - **Rollover Policy**: Unused tokens carry over or reset?
   - **Overage Handling**: Block usage or allow with notification

3. **Usage Alerts:**
   - Email admin at 80% of quota consumed
   - Notify users approaching their limit
   - Weekly usage reports

4. **Model Access by Role:**
   - Admins: All models, unlimited
   - Content Managers: Writing models, higher quota
   - Support Agents: Support models, medium quota
   - Standard Users: Basic models, lower quota

**Per-User Overrides:**

For specific users who need more/less access:
- Go to: Admin → Users → [Select User]
- Override default quota
- Enable/disable specific models
- Set custom limits

### Step 4: Monitor AI Usage

Track how AI is being used across your organization.

**AI Analytics Dashboard:**
- Total tokens consumed (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Usage by user, by model, by department
- Most popular models
- Cost tracking (if applicable)
- Performance metrics (response time, success rate)

**Optimization Tips:**
- Models with low usage can be disabled
- High usage indicates valuable models—increase quotas
- Monitor for unusual patterns (potential misuse)
- Review and adjust based on business priorities

### AI Model Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Start with 2-3 system models, expand gradually
- ✅ Test models thoroughly before rolling out to team
- ✅ Create task-based workflows for consistency
- ✅ Monitor usage and adjust quotas based on need
- ✅ Train your team on effective AI prompting
- ✅ Use specialized models for specialized tasks

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Enable all models at once (overwhelming for users)
- ❌ Set unlimited quotas without monitoring
- ❌ Use creative models for factual content
- ❌ Ignore user feedback on model performance
- ❌ Skip testing custom models before deployment
- ❌ Use AI for sensitive data without proper safeguards
