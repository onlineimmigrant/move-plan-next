bg-gradient-to-br from-teal-500 to-cyan-600
```

## üí° Recommendation

**Go with Option 1 (Teal/Cyan)** for these reasons:
1. ‚úÖ Modern and fresh without being too bold
2. ‚úÖ Excellent readability and accessibility
3. ‚úÖ Differentiates from standard blue while staying professional
4. ‚úÖ Works well in both dark and light contexts
5. ‚úÖ Popular in modern SaaS applications (Slack, Linear, etc.)

**Alternative**: If you want maximum familiarity, choose Option 3 (Green) - it's what billions of users are accustomed to from WhatsApp.
