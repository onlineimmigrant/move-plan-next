## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Customer Meeting Cards - Show Meeting Title and Host Name

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/modals/MeetingsModals/MeetingsBookingModal/MyBookingsList.tsx`
- `/src/app/api/meetings/bookings/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Meeting cards now show meeting title prominently at the top
- Host full name displayed with icon
- API updated to include host profile data via foreign key join

**UI Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Meeting Title (Large, bold)         │
│ 👤 Host: John Smith                 │
│ 📅 Oct 23, 2025  🕐 3:00 PM (30min)│
│ Status Badge | Time info            │
│ [Join Video Call] button            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. ✅ Admin/Host Meeting Cards - Show Customer Full Name

**File Modified:**

- Customer full name shown prominently with email in parentheses

**UI Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Meeting Title (Bold)                │
│ 👤 Jane Doe (jane@example.com)     │

```

### 3. ✅ VideoCall Window - Meeting Title & Host Badge

**UI Example:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. ⚠️ Multiple Meeting Rooms - Technical Limitation

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED (Browser API Limitation)

**Why It's Not Possible:**
- Twilio Video SDK limits: **1 room connection per browser tab**
- WebRTC (browser technology) has resource constraints
- Audio/video device access limited to one context at a time

**Workarounds Available:**

#### Option A: Multiple Browser Tabs (Recommended)
```
Tab 1: Manage Meetings Modal (admin panel)
Tab 2: Meeting Room A (video call)
Tab 3: Meeting Room B (video call)
```
- Admin opens different tabs for different meetings
- Can switch between tabs to join different rooms
- Can keep management panel open in one tab

#### Option B: Quick Switch Feature (Current Implementation)
- VideoCall modal is **independent** from management modal
- Admin can minimize video call (minimize button in header)
- Switch to meetings panel to see other meetings
- Leave current meeting and join another
- One meeting at a time, but quick switching

#### Option C: Future Enhancement - Meeting Queue
Could implement a "meeting queue" feature:
1. Show list of active meetings in sidebar
2. Click to switch between rooms (leaves current, joins new)
3. Visual indicator of which meeting admin is in
4. Not true simultaneous participation, but fast switching

**Current Behavior:**
- ✅ VideoCall at z-index 2000 (above everything)
- ✅ Can minimize video call
- ✅ Management modal stays open while in video call
- ✅ Can view other waiting participants while in a call
- ❌ Cannot join multiple rooms simultaneously

## API Changes

### GET /api/meetings/bookings

**Before:**
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  meeting_type:meeting_types(*)
`)
```

**After:**
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  meeting_type:meeting_types(*),
  host_profile:profiles!host_user_id(full_name, email)
`)
```

Now includes host profile information for customer views.

## Data Flow

### Customer Viewing Their Meetings:
```
1. Customer logs in
2. Opens "My Meetings" tab
3. API fetches bookings with host profiles
4. Cards display:
   - Meeting title
   - Host full name
   - Date/time
   - Status & join button
```

### Admin Viewing All Bookings:
```
1. Admin opens Manage Meetings
2. API fetches all organization bookings
3. Cards display:
   - Meeting title (from booking)
   - Customer full name & email
   - Date/time
   - Status & action buttons
```

### Joining Video Call:
```
1. User clicks "Join Video Call"
2. System checks: is user host/admin?
3. Passes meeting title + host flag to VideoCall
4. Header shows:
   - Meeting title
   - "Host" badge if user is host/admin
   - Connection status
   - Participant count
```

## Testing Checklist

### Customer Experience:
- [  ] Open "My Meetings"
- [  ] Verify meeting title is visible
- [  ] Verify host name appears
- [  ] Click join button
- [  ] Verify video call header shows meeting title
- [  ] Verify no "Host" badge for customer

### Admin Experience:
- [  ] Open "Manage Meetings"
- [  ] Verify meeting titles visible
- [  ] Verify customer names AND emails shown
- [  ] Join a meeting
- [  ] Verify "Host" badge appears in video call header
- [  ] Minimize video call
- [  ] Verify can see management panel
- [  ] Verify can see other waiting participants

### Multiple Meetings (Workaround):
- [  ] Open management panel in Tab 1
- [  ] Right-click meeting → "Open in new tab" (if applicable)
- [  ] Or manually open site in Tab 2
- [  ] Join Meeting A in Tab 2
- [  ] Open Tab 3, join Meeting B
- [  ] Verify audio/video works in each tab independently

## Known Limitations

1. **No Simultaneous Room Participation**
   - Technical limitation of Twilio/WebRTC
   - Not specific to this implementation
   - Industry-standard behavior

2. **One Video Call Per Tab**
   - Browser can only access camera/mic once per tab
   - Opening multiple calls in same tab will disconnect previous

3. **Host Badge Logic**
   - Shows "Host" for both meeting host AND admin users
   - All admins can host any meeting in their organization

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:
1. **Meeting Switcher Panel**
   - Sidebar showing all active meetings
   - Click to leave current and join another
   - Visual indicator of current meeting

2. **Meeting Notifications**
   - Toast when new participant enters waiting room
   - Even if admin is in another meeting
   - Requires real-time subscriptions

3. **Quick Join from Notification**
   - Click notification to leave current meeting and join
   - Streamlined workflow for handling multiple meetings

4. **Meeting History in Header**
   - Show recently joined meetings
   - Quick rejoin button
   - Save admin time

## Code Examples

### Accessing Host Name in Customer View:
```typescript
// In MyBookingsList.tsx
<span>Host: {(booking as any).host_profile?.full_name || 'Not specified'}</span>
```

### Displaying Meeting Title in Video Call:
```typescript
// In VideoCallHeader.tsx
<h2>
  {meetingTitle || 'Video Call'}
  {userIsHost && <span className="badge">Host</span>}
</h2>
```

### Checking if User is Host:
```typescript
// In ManagedVideoCall.tsx
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('role')
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single();

setUserIsAdmin(profile?.role === 'admin');
setUserIsHost(activeMeeting.host_user_id === user.id);
```
