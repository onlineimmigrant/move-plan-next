# TicketsAccountModal - Image Display Fix

## Issue: Customer uploaded images not displaying instantly

### Problem
- Customer uploads image and sends message
- Image doesn't display immediately
- Only appears after page reload or sending next message

### Root Cause
The handleRespond() function uploaded attachments but never loaded the signed URLs needed to display images.

### Solution
Added URL loading immediately after attachment upload:

```typescript
// After updating state with attachments
if (uploadedAttachments.length > 0) {
  const urlsMap: Record<string, string> = {};
  
  for (const attachment of uploadedAttachments) {
    if (isImageFile(attachment.file_type)) {
      const { url } = await getAttachmentUrl(attachment.file_path);
      if (url) {
        urlsMap[attachment.id] = url;
      }
    }
  }
  
  setAttachmentUrls(prev => ({ ...prev, ...urlsMap }));
}
```

### Result
✅ Images now display instantly after customer uploads and sends them
✅ Matches the working behavior of TicketsAdminModal
✅ No page reload required

## Files Modified
