# Admin Realtime Debug Test

## Current Status:
✅ **Customer modal** - Realtime works! Sees admin responses instantly
❌ **Admin modal** - Not updating when customer sends message

## Test This:

1. **Refresh admin window** (hard refresh)
2. **Open console in admin window**
3. **Admin: Open a ticket**
4. **Customer: Send a message to that ticket**

## What to Look For in Admin Console:

You should see this sequence:

```
✅ Realtime: Response change {payload with new response data}
🔍 Starting refresh for ticket: {ticket-id}
✅ Ticket data fetched
✅ Responses fetched: X
🔄 Selected ticket refreshed - responses: X Previous: Y
```

## Possible Issues:

### Scenario 1: You See "Starting refresh" but NO responses fetched
**Problem**: RLS policy might be blocking admin from seeing responses
**Share**: The exact error message

### Scenario 2: You See "Responses fetched: X" but count doesn't increase
**Problem**: The realtime event is firing BEFORE the database is updated
**Solution**: Add a small delay before refresh

### Scenario 3: You DON'T see "Starting refresh" at all
**Problem**: Realtime event not firing for admin
**Check**: Is admin console showing "✅ Realtime: Response change"?

### Scenario 4: Count increases but UI doesn't update
**Problem**: React not re-rendering
**Share**: Full console output

## Quick Fix to Try:

If you see the realtime event but refresh doesn't happen, try adding a delay.

In the admin console, manually test the refresh:
```javascript
// Type this in console while viewing a ticket
// This will force a refresh
window.location.reload()
```

## What to Share:

Copy the **complete console output** from the admin window after the customer sends a message.

Include:
- All "✅ Realtime" messages
- All "🔍 Starting refresh" messages  
- Any errors (❌)
- The response count numbers
