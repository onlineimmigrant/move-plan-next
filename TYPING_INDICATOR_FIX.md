# Typing Indicator Fix - Channel Subscription Issue

## Problem
Typing indicators were not displaying because the channels were misconfigured:
- Customer modal was subscribing to `customer-tickets-channel` and broadcasting to the same channel
- Admin modal was subscribing to `tickets-admin-channel` but broadcasting to `customer-tickets-channel`
- They were on different channels, so broadcasts never reached the listeners

## Solution
Implemented **per-ticket typing channels** with dedicated useEffect hooks:

### Architecture
- Each ticket gets its own typing channel: `typing-${ticketId}`
- Both modals subscribe to the SAME typing channel for a given ticket
- Broadcasts and listeners are now properly synchronized

### Customer Modal Changes
1. **Dedicated Typing Channel useEffect** (Lines 210-247)
   - Subscribes to `typing-${selectedTicket.id}` whenever ticket changes
   - Listens for admin typing events (`payload.isAdmin === true`)
   - Auto-unsubscribes when ticket changes or modal closes
   
2. **Broadcast Function** (Lines 490-500)
   - Sends to `typing-${selectedTicket.id}`
   - Includes `isAdmin: false` flag

3. **Cleanup**
   - Removed typing subscription from main realtime channel
   - Typing channel now managed independently

### Admin Modal Changes
1. **Dedicated Typing Channel useEffect** (Lines 351-388)
   - Subscribes to `typing-${selectedTicket.id}` whenever ticket changes
   - Listens for customer typing events (`payload.isAdmin === false`)
   - Auto-unsubscribes when ticket changes or modal closes

2. **Broadcast Function** (Lines 1061-1071)
   - Sends to `typing-${selectedTicket.id}`
   - Includes `isAdmin: true` flag

3. **Cleanup**
   - Removed typing subscription from main realtime channel
   - Typing channel now managed independently

## Key Benefits
âœ… **Per-Ticket Isolation**: Each ticket has its own typing channel
âœ… **Dynamic Subscription**: Typing channel updates automatically when ticket changes
âœ… **Clean Separation**: Typing logic separated from main data channels
âœ… **Proper Cleanup**: Channels unsubscribe when ticket changes or modal closes
âœ… **Self-Exclusion**: `broadcast: { self: false }` prevents seeing your own typing

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open customer modal and admin modal side-by-side
- [ ] Select the same ticket in both modals
- [ ] Type in customer modal â†’ Admin should see "Customer is typing..."
- [ ] Type in admin modal â†’ Customer should see "Admin is typing..."
- [ ] Verify indicator auto-hides after 3 seconds
- [ ] Switch tickets â†’ Verify typing channel updates correctly
- [ ] Check console logs for channel subscription confirmations

## Console Debug Logs
Look for these in the browser console:
```
ðŸ”” Setting up typing channel for ticket: [ticket-id]
ðŸ“¡ Typing channel status (Customer/Admin): SUBSCRIBED
ðŸŽ¯ Typing event received (Customer/Admin): {...}
ðŸ”Œ Unsubscribing from typing channel: [ticket-id]
```
